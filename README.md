## Usage Instructions
If you'd like to run your own instance of this server, you'll need to deploy it somewhere and configure it with your API keys. A few easy options are provided below, though you can also deploy it to any other service you'd like if you know what you're doing and the service supports Node.js.

### Personal Use (single-user)
If you just want to run the proxy server to use yourself without hosting it for others:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 18.0.0
2. Clone this repository
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API keys. See the [.env.example](./.env.example) file for an example.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`
5. Run `npm run build`
6. Run `npm start`

#### Updating
You must re-run `npm install` and `npm run build` whenever you pull new changes from the repository.

#### Local Development
Use `npm run start:dev` to run the proxy in development mode with watch mode enabled. Use `npm run type-check` to run the type checker across the project.

### Self-hosting
[See here for instructions on how to self-host the application on your own VPS or local machine and expose it to the internet for others to use.](./docs/self-hosting.md)

**Ensure you set the `TRUSTED_PROXIES` environment variable according to your deployment.** Refer to [.env.example](./.env.example) and [config.ts](./src/config.ts) for more information.

## Building
To build the project, run `npm run build`. This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and output it to the `build` directory. You should run this whenever you pull new changes from the repository.

Note that if you are trying to build the server on a very memory-constrained (<= 1GB) VPS, you may need to run the build with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=2048 npm run build` to avoid running out of memory during the build process, assuming you have swap enabled.  The application itself should run fine on a 512MB VPS for most reasonable traffic levels.

## Forking
If you are forking the repository on GitGud, you may wish to disable GitLab CI/CD or you will be spammed with emails about failed builds due not having any CI runners. You can do this by going to *Settings > General > Visibility, project features, permissions* and then disabling the "CI/CD" feature.
